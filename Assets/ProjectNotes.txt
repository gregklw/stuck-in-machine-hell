Addressables:
-Addressables.UnloadSceneAsync() seems to remove any references to AssetReferences thus rendering them null even if they're on ScriptableObjects
-Loading a GameObject marked as an Addressable will also automatically bundle every component that goes along with said GameObject

How to setup Remote Asset Addressables with CCD:
-Modify profile to use Remote
-Create new bundle and add schema as well as set to custom/remote
-Create/link Addressables for assets
-Build to CCD
-Copy link generated on CCD Unity DevOps website and use it as remote (should already be done automatically if using build to CCD option)

ParticleSystem:
-Start speed set to 0 will not make particles appear...need to make it at least 0.0001
